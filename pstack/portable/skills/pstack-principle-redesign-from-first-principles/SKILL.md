## Codex / Claude Code compatibility

Apply this section before the upstream workflow. Read [host mappings](../../HOSTS.md) when using model configuration, delegation, history, automation, or Cursor-specific tools. Resolve bundled skills by their original directory name using [the skill map](../../skill-map.json); their installed names have a `pstack-` prefix. Resolve all scripts relative to this skill directory.

Use the current host's tools and inherit the parent model by default. Cursor model slugs, cloud agents, `Task` parameters, custom modes, and `/loop` are examples of upstream capabilities, not tools to assume exist here. Preserve host instructions and the user's authorization scope for every action.

# Redesign From First Principles

When integrating a change, don't bolt it onto the existing design. Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from the start.

- Read all affected files and understand the current design
- Ask: "if we were writing this from scratch with this new requirement, what would we build?"
- Propagate the change through every reference: types, docs, examples, rationale sections
- Think about the whole redesign, then deliver it incrementally

This is the method for preserving option value when integrating changes into an existing design.
