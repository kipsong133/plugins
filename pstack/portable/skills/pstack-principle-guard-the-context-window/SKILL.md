## Codex / Claude Code compatibility

Apply this section before the upstream workflow. Read [host mappings](../../HOSTS.md) when using model configuration, delegation, history, automation, or Cursor-specific tools. Resolve bundled skills by their original directory name using [the skill map](../../skill-map.json); their installed names have a `pstack-` prefix. Resolve all scripts relative to this skill directory.

Use the current host's tools and inherit the parent model by default. Cursor model slugs, cloud agents, `Task` parameters, custom modes, and `/loop` are examples of upstream capabilities, not tools to assume exist here. Preserve host instructions and the user's authorization scope for every action.

# Guard the Context Window

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
