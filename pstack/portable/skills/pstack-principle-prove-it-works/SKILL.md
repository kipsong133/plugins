## Codex / Claude Code compatibility

Apply this section before the upstream workflow. Read [host mappings](../../HOSTS.md) when using model configuration, delegation, history, automation, or Cursor-specific tools. Resolve bundled skills by their original directory name using [the skill map](../../skill-map.json); their installed names have a `pstack-` prefix. Resolve all scripts relative to this skill directory.

Use the current host's tools and inherit the parent model by default. Cursor model slugs, cloud agents, `Task` parameters, custom modes, and `/loop` are examples of upstream capabilities, not tools to assume exist here. Preserve host instructions and the user's authorization scope for every action.

# Prove It Works

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Do not infer from proxies, self-reports, or "it compiles."

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

Check the real thing, not a proxy:
- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

## Script the check when you can

The strongest proof is a deterministic script that re-runs the same comparison, not a one-time eyeball. Write the script, run it, and keep its output as an artifact a reviewer can re-run instead of trusting your word.

Keep the artifact visible for the human. Commit it only for large or complex work where the trail has to be auditable later, like a big port or migration (the **show-me-your-work** skill).
