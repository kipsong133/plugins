## Codex / Claude Code compatibility

Apply this section before the upstream workflow. Read [host mappings](../../HOSTS.md) when using model configuration, delegation, history, automation, or Cursor-specific tools. Resolve bundled skills by their original directory name using [the skill map](../../skill-map.json); their installed names have a `pstack-` prefix. Resolve all scripts relative to this skill directory.

Use the current host's tools and inherit the parent model by default. Cursor model slugs, cloud agents, `Task` parameters, custom modes, and `/loop` are examples of upstream capabilities, not tools to assume exist here. Preserve host instructions and the user's authorization scope for every action.

# Make Operations Idempotent

Design operations so they converge to the correct state regardless of how many times they run or where they start from. Every state-mutating operation should answer: "What happens if this runs twice? What happens if the previous run crashed halfway?"

**Why:** Commands, lifecycle operations, and processing loops run where crashes, restarts, and retries are normal. If partial state changes the next run's outcome, every restart becomes a debugging session.

**The pattern:**
- Convergent startup: scan for existing state, clean stale artifacts, adopt live sessions
- Content-based cleanup: compare by content equivalence, not creation order
- Self-healing locks: use PID-based stale lock detection
- Idempotent scheduling: failed work respawns cleanly, fresh input regenerated after each cycle

**The test:**
1. What happens if this runs twice in a row?
2. What happens if the previous run crashed at every possible point?
3. Does re-execution converge to the same end state?

If any answer is "it depends on what state was left behind," the operation needs a reconciliation step.
